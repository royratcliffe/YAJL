 * Internet connection or from files via a read buffer. However, in those cases,
 * using -parseData:error: will prove wiser because UTF-8 encodings may not
 * always align against buffer boundaries. Parsing data rather than strings
 * correctly realigns the multi-byte character codes. Be advised therefore,
 * converting buffered subsections of the data to UTF-8 may throw up some
 * decoding problems.
